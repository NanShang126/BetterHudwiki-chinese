3. enter the following
``` yaml
example_font:
  file: example.ttf
  scale: 16
```

## use minecraft font
Note: this mimics the Minecraft default font and does not use the default font, so you cannot use image fonts such as glyphs added by plugins like itemsadder.
``` yaml
default_font:
  scale: 16
  merge-default-bitmap: true
```
If use the default font, can't use glyphs.


## how to add a glyph
``` yaml
example_font:
  file: example.ttf
  scale: 16
  images:
    star:
      name: "star.png"
      x: 0
      y: 0
      scale: 2.0
```
can add an image with this feel and then use it in the same way as `<image:star>` in a text layout pattern.

# how to change the first bossbar font
1. font.yml `merge-default-bitmap: false`

2. place the font file in the betterhud plugin folder and modify the font name in config.yml.
